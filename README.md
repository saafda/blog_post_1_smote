# Visualizing SMOTE: Understanding Synthetic Oversampling with Intuition and Code
This repository accompanies a blog post on SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), a popular method for handling class imbalance in machine learning.

It includes:

Visual examples of SMOTE applied to both well-structured and challenging class shapes (e.g., Ï€ symbol, circles)

Explanations of how SMOTE works, where it performs well, and where it breaks down

Organized code that separates logic, plotting, and analysis for clarity

Jupyter Notebooks to explore the technique interactively
